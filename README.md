Google Earth Engine (GEE) to visualize environmental data. This includes using an image collection from NASA's FLDAS (Flooding and Drought Assessment System) dataset through this link: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_FLDAS_NOAH01_C_GL_M_V001#bands. This represents the average precipitation mapping throughout the world during the time period from 1/1/2024-8/1/2024. 

To interpret this visualization, the spectrum of colors convey different precipitation levels. Darker colors such as black or blue will mean lower rainfall, while brighter colors like red will mean higher rainfall.
